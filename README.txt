Getting Started
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are unfamiliar with the WICED SDK, please refer to the 
WICED Quickstart Guide located here: <WICED-SDK>/doc/WICED-QSG2xx-R.pdf
The WICED Quickstart Guide documents the process to setup a computer for
use with the WICED SDK, IDE and WICED Evaluation Board. 

The WICED SDK includes lots of sample applications in the <WICED-SDK>/Apps directory.
Applications included with the SDK are outlined below.
 apps/demo : Demonstration Applications
   - Applications demonstrating how to integrate various WICED API features 
 apps/snip : Application Snippets
   - Various applications to demonstrate usage of individual WICED APIs          
 apps/test : Test & Utility Applications
   - console      : Provides various test features including Iperf for throughput testing 
   - mfg_test     : Manufacturing Test application to enable radio performance and certification testing
 apps/waf  : WICED Application Framework
   - bootloader   : Bootloader application used in conjunction with the WICED Application Framework
   - sflash_write : Serial flash application used to write data into external serial flash
 apps/wwd : Wiced Wi-Fi Driver Applications to demonstrate advanced usage of the low layer Wi-Fi driver
    
To obtain a complete list of build commands and options, enter the following text in the
base WICED SDK directory on a command line:
$> make

To compile, download and run the Wi-Fi scan application on the Broadcom BCM943362WCD4 evaluation platform, 
enter the following text on a command line (a period character is used to reference applications 
in sub-directories) :
$> make snip.scan-BCM943362WCD4 download run

The default RTOS and Network Stack components are defined in the WICED configuration makefile  
at <WICED-SDK>/tools/makefiles/wiced_config.mk. The default I/O bus component is defined in the platform
makefile at <WICED-SDK>/platforms/<Platform>/<Platform>.mk. Defaults may be bypassed by specifying the 
component as part of the build string if desired as shown in the following example.
$> make snip.scan-BCM943362WCD4-FreeRTOS-LwIP-SDIO download run
       
Source code, headers and reference information for supported platforms are available 
in the <WICED-SDK>/platforms directory. Source code, headers, linker scripts etc that 
are common to all platforms are available in the <WICED-SDK>/WICED/platform directory.

   -----------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----+---------+---------+  
   
   * WICED-SDK-3.1.2 Platform Restrictions
       STM32F1xx is not yet supported
       Freescale K60 is not yet supported
       BCM943341WCD1
         - Wi-Fi Direct not support
         - SPI bus not supported
       BCM4390WCD2
         - Wi-Fi Direct not supported
         - WPS may timeout with some access points
         - Software reset not yet supported. OTA upgrade requires manual reset 
     
   * Wi-Fi Powersave (1)
       The WLAN chip requires an external 32kHz sleep clock input during powersave.
       Platforms that do not support Wi-Fi powersave (per the table above) are
       not capable of driving the WLAN sleep clock. An external 32kHz clock is 
       required for these platforms.

 * libc does not include support for printing uint64_t (long long)
   
 * RTOS detection may cause OpenOCD to crash in the following situation:
     GDB has an elf containing a known RTOS loaded, and your app is using the 
     RTOS memory for other purposes. This situation may occur while debugging 
     the bootloader
     SOLUTION : Remove " -rtos auto " from the <WICED-SDK>/Tools/OpenCD/OpenOCD 
                .cfg file that matches your hardware debugger 
                (ie. BCM9WCD1EVAL1.cfg for WICED Evaluation Boards) 

 * AP mode when running with WPA/WPA2 encryption is limited to 4 STA clients
 
Tools
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The GNU ARM toolchain is from Yagarto, http://yagarto.de

Programming and debugging is enabled by OpenOCD, http://openocd.berlios.de

The standard WICED Evaluation board (BCM9WCD1EVAL1) provides two physical 
programming/debug interfaces for the STM32 host microprocessor: USB-JTAG and direct 
JTAG. The WICED Evaluation board driver additionally provides a single USB-serial 
port for debug printing or UART console purposes.

The USB-JTAG interface is enabled by the libftdi/libusb open source driver,
http://intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi. 
The direct JTAG interface works with third party JTAG programmers including 
Segger, IAR J-Link and Olimex ARM-USB-TINY series. OpenOCD works with the libftdi/libusb 
USB-JTAG driver shipped with the WICED SDK and commercially available JTAG drivers 
available from third party vendors.

Building, programming and debugging of applications is achieved using either a 
command line interface or the WICED IDE as described in the Quickstart Guide.

Instructions to use the IAR toolchain are provided in a README located in the 
following directory: <WICED-SDK>/Tools/IAR
